Q. Do the catholic Clergy insist that all the bulls of the
Pope are en titled to obedience? ·

A. By no means: The Pope we consider as the executive
authority in the Catholic Church3 and when he issues a bull,
enforcing a discipline, already settled by a general council, such
bull is entitled to respect: But he may issue bulls which would
regard local discipline, or other matters not already defined,
and in that case his bull would be treated by usin 811811 manner
as it might seem good to us,

Q. In the creed of Pius the 4.ιιι 111818 818 1118 following
words, «I promise and swear obedience to the Roman Bishop,
she successor of St. Peter3» what is the meaning of these words?

A. Of course that we would obey him in those things to
which his authority extends3 namely, spiritual matters, or 1118
execution of decrees regularly defined by General 0011118118, 81111
accepted of by' us; for they are not all the decree of even
General 0011118118 11111811 818 received in each kingdom3 For
instance, the decrees of the 001111811 of Trent regarding disci-
pline are not received in the kingdom of France; The decree
of the Council of Trent regarding a particular discipline is not
received in the province of Dublin in Leinster, though it is
received in the other parts ofIreland; all the decrees 111811 81811
of general 0011118118, 11111811 1888 811 1118 decrees of the Pope, can-
not have force unless they are received formally by the nation
which they regard, or whose discipline is affected by them:
each Church 1188 118 rights, and those rights cannot be subverted
or affected by any proceeding on the part of the Pope, without
1118 80118111181188 of the hierarchy of such 011111811.

Q. If the Pope were to intermeddle with the rights of the
King, or with the allegiance which 0811101188 owe 10 1118 Κ1118;
111181 would be the consequence, so far as the Catholic Glergy
are concerned‘?

A. The consequence would 108 that we should oppose him
by every means in our power, even by the exercise of our
spiritual authority.

Q. In what manner could you exercise that authority?

A. By preaching to the people that their dut-y to God as
0811101188 required of them to oppose every person who would
interfere in any way with that right, which the law of nature,
and the positive law of God, established in their Prince, a Prince
whom we as subjects were bound to support3 we would there-
fore exercise our spiritual authority by preaching the Gospel

. to the people, and by 1888111118 them to oppose the Pope, if he

interfered with the temporal rights of our King,
