THE Mos‘r REv. Dr. Mmum.

17 May 1825 examined.

Q. It has been stated in evidence before this committee
that Doctor Troy, in the year 1793 published a declaration or
letter, in which he says that Catholics are obliged to submit to
the decisiom, and tho the decrees of thePope on points of
faith or moraIS‚ which are expressly or tacitly assented to, or
not dissented from, by the majority of Bishops, representing
and governing the Church, dispersed: what is to be understood
from this declaration?

A. That it is the doctrine of every Catholic. ——— The Pope,
as the Head of the Church‚ has a righf to address a doctrinal
letter o the whole Church. By that very act he summons the
Pastors of the Church to say whether or not that is conformable
o the catholic Faith3 and whether they distinctly express their
assent to it, or tacitly signify it by not dissenting from it: It
then becomes a declaration that such is the belief of the Church
at large3 and as the Chnrch, whether dispersed at large or
assembled in its General Councils, is infallible, its decisions are
a rule of Faith to which every Catholic is bound to submit.

Q. There is nothing in this declaration which debars the
Catholic Bishops of Ireland from exercising their judgment upon
those decisions and decrees of the Pope so submitted‘?

A. Quite the contrary: they are callod upon to exercise
their udgment‚ it is addi-essed to them for the very purpose of
eliciting their judgment‚ that it may be thus ascertained whether
that doctrine is conformable with the general belief of the Churoh.

Q. It has been stated in evidence that in the Class-Book
of Maynooth it is laid down that the Pope is superior to all
Bishops, taken jointly or separately‚ or even to Provincial and
National Councils: how is this statement to be understood?

A. He is s0‚ because his jurisdiction extends over the whole
Ohurch; whereas the jurisdiction of a single Bishop‚ or of the
Bishops of a Province‚ or of the Bishops of a Naffon, does
not extend bepond the limits that are implied by these denomi-
nations. Moreover‚ the decrees of Provincial or National SynodS‚
according to our own discipline, have not effect without the
confirmation of the Pope. On that account his jurisdiction is
stated to be superior to, or more extensive than, the jurisdiction
just alluded to,

Q. The doctrine so laid down in the Class-Book does not
go to say that the authority of the Pope is independent of,x
and superior to the authority of councils?
