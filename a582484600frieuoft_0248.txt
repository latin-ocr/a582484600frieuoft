D. D. examinecL 22 March 1825.

Q. Will you be so good as to explain to the Committee
what is the nature and origin of the authority of the Pope.

A. The origin of the authority of the Pope we hold to be
from God, who established a head of the Church which he
wished to appoint upon earth; the nature of his authority is
that he is the executive power of that Ghurch; his office is
to watch over and enforce the observance of the canons: 110
is besides the Centre of Catholic Unity, the great link that
holds together all the different parts of the Catholic Body3 so
that each Catholic troughout the world, finding himseff in com-
munion with the head of the Church, may know thereby that
he is in communion with the whole bidy.

Q. Is his authority confined altogether to a spiritual authority?

A. Wholly confined to a spiritual authority, according to
the words of Our Saviour: «My Kingdom is not of this world.»

Q. Is that authority under the controul of General Councils ⁶?

A. That authority is limited byX the councils and canons
of the Church3 he is the executive power of the Church, appoin-
ted to preside over it, and enforce its canons or laws, Those
canons vest in individuals, for instance in BishOPS, certain
rights», which of course it is the duty of the Pope to protect,
and no to violate; his authority is thus limited by those canons,

Q. To what extend, and in what manner does a Catholic
profess to obey the Pope‘?

A. Solely in spiritual matterS, or in such mixed matters
as come under his government, such as marriage for instance,
which we hold to be a sacrament as well as a civil contract3
as it is a sacrament it is a spiritual thing, and comes under
the jurisdiction of the Pope; of course 110 has authority over
that spiritual part of it: but this authority does not affect the
civil rights of the individuals contracting.

Q. Does this obedience detract from what is due from a
Catholic to the State under which he lives?

A. Not in the least3 the powers are wholly distinct.

Q. Does it justify an objection that is made to CatholicS,
that their allegiance is divided‘?

A. Their allegiance in civil matters is completely undivided.

Q. Is the duty which the Catholic owes to the Pope, 2

and the duty which he owes to the King‚ really and substan· ,.
tially distinct? ὲ
Α. Wholly distinct.
