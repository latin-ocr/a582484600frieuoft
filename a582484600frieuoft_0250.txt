Q. Is the Pope's authority received by, 'the Irish Roman
Catholic Church as supreme in matters of Faith and morals?

A. We recognize him as the head of our Church3 and there
fore give him the executive authority. But that is limited by
the Sacred Canons: he cannot create new articles of Faith.

Q. Are Papal Bulls received in Ireland.

A. They are. But we would not receive any Bull that
would trench 011 our rights as a National Church.

Q. By the creed of Pope Pius the 4¹¹², are not all Roman
Catholics required to profess and receive all things delivered,
defined or declared by the canons and General Councils‘?

A. I think I was asked that question at least substantially
on a former occasion, and I answered that Catholics feel them
selves bound to receive the canons adopted by universal coun-
cils, and received universally by the Church, or surch parts of
such canons as are so received by the Universal Church, and
that regard faith and morals3 but not in matters of discipline.

Q. In matters of saith and morals does it require that any canon
of a Genera] Council shall be received by any particular Church?

A. The canons of Councils, where they define a matter as
an article of Faith‚ and propose it to the belief of the Univer-
sal Church, if this council be acknowledged to have been an
Universal one, the Faithful are bound to admit that declaration
of the Article of Faith as true.

The Church has uniformly for nine centurieS, by her Popes
themselveS, by her Praetice, and by her doctrineS, and by her
AcademieS, maintained, that the Popes have 110 right whatever
to interfere with the temporal sovereignities or Rights of Kings
or Princes3 and if there have been fiatterers of the Court of
Rome, who maintainend that the Pope had that right so to
interfere, it is hard to make us responsible for their opinions3,
whereaS, both as Individuals and as a nation, we have disre-
garded this doctrine, and always opposed with our lives and
fortunes those Bulls, when they were sent amongst us: Nor can
it be charged to the account of our country that we ever
attended to Bulls which went in any way to affect the Rights
of our Kings, to whom we have been most devotedly attached,
at all times. '

We do then reject that doctrine, as not supported by, or
as opposed to the ScriptureS, and to the Tradition of our
Fathers; and to many authorities of the Italian Church itself,
of the German Church, of the French Church, of the English
Church, and of the Spanish Church‚ and as resting on no‘
foundation but the unauthorized proceedings of Popes -and their ’
Italian FlattererS, and we ought not to be charged with it. -
