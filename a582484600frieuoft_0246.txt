Extracts from the select Commitee appointed to enquire into the
State of [reland. 1825.

THE Rmffr REVEREND JAMES Dour, D. D.

examined 16 March 1825.

Q. Is the authority of the Pape in spiritual matters absolute
or limited.

A. It is limited.

Q. Is it limited by the authority of Councils‘?

A. It is limited by the decrees of Councils already passed;
it is limited by usage, aISO, in this respect, that when he directs
any decree respecting local discipline to any nation whatsoever,
beyond the limits of his own territory (I mean by his own
territory, what is called the Patrimony of St. Peter or the
Papal states), the assent of the Bishops of such country is
necessary in order that his Decree have effect.

March 18 1825.

Q. What is your opinion respecting the conduct of those
Popes who have interfered with StateS, and extended their
pretensions to the civil business of men.

A. I do not like to speak harshly of men who have already
passed out of this world; but I think that the Popes who so
acted have done much mischief, and very often have acted upon
a power, or upon an authority, which they had no right to
exercise; however when Popes did interfere with the civil busi-
ness of men, or with the temporal rights of PrinceS, Ι find
that in almost every instance in which such interference occurred,
they professed to act on rights, which they had acquired by
compact or cession, or some act on the part of those sovereigns
or those countries whith which they so interfered; and l do not
find that interference was grounded in almost· any case upon
their spiritual authority only.
