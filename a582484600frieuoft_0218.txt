Pitt, Gubernii Anglici nempe primo ministrO, ex officio
interrogatae fuerint, solemniter et unanimiter hanc sententiam
damnaverunt, et ei contradixerunt. Anne Ecclesia Catholica, —
anne ipsi Pontifices — eas 113110 ob causam damnaverunt ⁸? Nonne
Catholici, ubivis fere gentium, 11113 voce eam rejiciunt; suntne
eo minus Catholici? Fidenter assero, idque re bene perpensa,
perpaucos ex Catholicis hodie inveniri posse (1111 eam non rejiciant ‚·
pauciores adhuc qui eam teneant3 et quod Romae etiam, saltem
publice non tradatur? ¹

Tacitus igitur assensus episcoporum per quatuor saltem
saecula 11011 effecit ut sententia de potestate Romanorum Ponti-
ficum in temporalibus pro doctrina fidei Catholicae haberetur,
ut ex se patet, cum alioquin eam nunc rejicere esset a Catholi-
cae Ecclesiae unitate deficere.

In ista sententia duo quidem sunt distinguenda: potestas
ipsa, et ratio ejus. Potestas ipsa suum fundamentum habuit in
rerum adjunctis3 et, ut plurimum, 111 bonum commune cessit.
Ratio potestatis non erat, — ut Pontifices asserebant, — Divina
auctoritaS, eis tamquam primatum tenentibus in Ecclesia divini-
tus data: sed ex rerum adjunctis consentiente Orbe ChristianO,
orta. Publico jure agnita est; ideoque erat legitima, Pontificibus
inerat, non quia tanquam Pontifices eam a Christo accepissent,
sed quia praeter eos nemo esset qui eam, tunc temporiS,
forte necessariam, exercere potuisset. Eam Divinae Ordinationi

¹ ‹But the Papacy invested itself with temporal power3 31111, 111 1110 middle
ages, it claimed 1110 right to depose princes and to absolve their subjects
from the oath of allegiance. — Be it so: what then? Was this accession of
temporal power ever viewed as 311 0330111131 prerogative of the Papacy? Or
was it not considered merely as an accidental appendage: the creature of pecu-
liar circumstances? Are there any examples of such alleged usurpations during
the first ten centuries of its history? Has this power been exercised, or even
claimed, by the Roman Pontiffs, for the last three centuries? If these two
facts are undoubted‚ -- 33 they certainly are , - then how maintain that a
belief in the Papacy involves a recognition of its temporal power? The latter
was never certainty a doctrine a of the Church. If it was, where is the proof ; where
the Church definition that made it 3 doctrine? Five leading Catholic Universities —
(Sorbonne. Louvaine, Doway, Alcala and Salamanca) —- when officially called
on by Mr. Pitt, prime minister of Great Britain, (1788) solemnly and unani-
mously disclaimed this opinion, and maintained the contrary. Did the Catholie
Church, did the Popes ever rebuke them for the disclaimer‘? Do not Catholics
all over the world now almost unanimously disclaim it and are they the less
catholic for this? I fearlessl assert,— and I do it so advisedly, — that there
are very few Catholics at t 0 present day, who do not reject this opinion:
that there are still fewer who maintain it ; and that it is not defended , at
least publicly, (a) even in Rome itself. Lectures on the Evidences of Catholicity.
