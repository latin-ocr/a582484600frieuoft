Q. How far is the claim that some Popes have set up to
temporal authority opposed to Scripture and Tradition?

A. As far 'as it may have been exercised as coming from
a right granted to him by God, it appears to me to be con÷
trary ’to Scripture and Tradition: but as far as it may have
been exercised in consequence of a right conferred on him by
the different Christian Powers, who looked up to him at one
time as the great parent of Christendom, who appointed him as
the arbitrator of their concerns, many of whom submitted their
kingdoms to him, and laid them at his feet consenting to receive
them back from him, as fiefs, the case is different. The power
that he exercised under that authority, of course passed away,
when those temporal princeS, who granted it, chose to withdraw
it, His spiritual power does not allow him to dethrone KingS,
or to absolve their subjects from the allegiance due to them,
and any attempt of that kind I would consider contrary to
Scripture and Tradition.

Q. Do the Roman Catholic Clergy insist that all the Bulls
of the Pope are entitled to obedience‘?

A. The Roman Catholic doctrine in respect to Bulls from
the Pope is that they are always to be treated with respect;
but i those Bulls or Rescripts proceeding from the Pope do
contain doctrines or matters which are not compatible with the
discipline of the particular Church to which they may be
directed, they feel it their duty then to remonstrate respect-
fully, and not to receive the regulations that may emanate from

1116 Pope.

Q. Cau you state in what respect the national canons recei-
ved in Ireland, or any particular construction put upon the
general canons, differ from those which are received in other

countries‘?
A. For instance, a particular church, or the canons of a

· “ particular church, might define that the authority of a general

council was superior to that of the Pope: such canon may be

- received, for instance in Ireland or in France, and might not

be received in Italy or Spain.
